## Description

This addon for WoW Classic aims to replicate the ping functionality of WoW Retail as closely as possible. Due to API limitations, it's not a 100% recreation, but it still provides a highly useful tool for quickly marking monsters, players, or NPCs.

With easy-to-use features, players can quickly place raid markers on important targets, making coordination in both PvE and PvP scenarios more efficient. While not identical to the Retail version, this addon offers great functionality for target management in WoW Classic.

##How to Use:

-   First, assign a hotkey in the WoW keybindings menu. Look for "Mark and Ping" in the list, and choose a key that suits you. You can assign any key you prefer for quick access to the addon’s functionality.
-   Next, hover your mouse over an NPC, monster, or player and press the assigned key to mark them. This will send an alert to all group members and place a raid marker on the selected unit.

##Commands:

-   **/mping volume** <high|medium|low> – Set the volume level for the ping sound (defaults to medium).
-   **/mping ping** – Plays the ping sound for testing.
